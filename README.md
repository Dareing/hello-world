Introduction
Rediscovering that I have a lot of command-line coding experience going all the way back to high school
when we coded in BASIC with teletype machines. In college I leared FORTRAN then SPSS using green-screen and JCL, then
on to grad school where I coded with SAS. That carried through to my work in the airlines and non-profits picking
up along the way SQL.  But it really all began when I was in kindergarten.  My father was a professor, and I used
to help him load punch cards into the reader. Never throught of myself as a programmer as my fields of study were
political science and public policy. So now here I am, reinventing myself as a data scientist.
